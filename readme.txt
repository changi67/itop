2. INSTALLATION
   ============

2.1. Requirements
     ------------
Server configuration:
iTop is based on the AMP (Apache / MySQL / PHP) platform and requires PHP 5.3 and
MySQL 5. The installation of iTop does not require any command line access to the
server. The only operations required to install iTop are: copying the files to the
server and browsing web pages. iTop can be installed on any web server supporting
PHP 5.3: Apache, IIS, nginx...

End-user configuration:
Although iTop should work with most modern web browsers, the application has been
tested mostly with Firefox 36+, IE9+, Safari 5 and Chrome. iTop was designed for
at least a 1024x768 screen resolution. Flash version 8 or higher is still required
for displaying some charts.

2.2. Install procedure
     -----------------
1) Make sure that you have a properly configured instance of Apache/PHP/MySQL running
2) Unpack the files contained in the zipped package, and copy the content of the "web"
   directory in a directory served by your web server.
3) Check the access rights on the files/folders: the setup needs to have write access
   either to the directory where iTop is installed or to the following subdirectories
   (create them if needed)
     - conf
     - data
     - env-production
     - log
4) Point your web browser to the URL corresponding to the directory where the files
   have been unzipped and follow the indications on the screen.
  
If you wish to re-launch the installation process (for example in order to install
more modules), just make sure that the configuration file (located at <itop>/conf/production/config-itop.php)
is writable by the web server (on Windows: remove the "read-only" flag, on Linux
adjust the rights of the file) and point your browser to <itop>/setup/.

2.3. cron.php
     --------
The following features will require the activation of CRON.PHP:
 - asynchronous emails. By default, this option is disabled. To enable it, set 'email_asynchronous' to 1 in the configuration file.
 - check ticket SLA. Tickets reaching the limits will be passed into Escalation TTO/TTR states.

More information into the Wiki: https://wiki.openitop.org/doku.php?id=2_0_3:admin:cron

You can get a status of the cron "tasks" with the command:

php cron.php --auth_user=admin_login --auth_pwd=admin_pwd --status_only=1

The output will look as shown below:
+---------------------------+---------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+
| Task Class                | Status  | Last Run            | Next Run            | Nb Run | Avg. Dur. |

| EmailBackgroundProcess    | active  | 2013-03-28 10:32:27 | 2013-03-28 10:32:57 |     12 |   7.089 s |

2.4. Upgrading from 2.x.x
     --------------------
The version 2.2.0 if fully compatible with 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3 and 2.1.0. Due to few database changes,
and new modules/files that have to be installed, you must run the setup when upgrading (whatever the original
version).

If the location of mysql binaries is in the "path", the setup proposes to perform a full backup
of iTop (database + configuration file) using mysqldump.

Here is how to upgrade, step by step, a 2.x.x instance of iTop:

1) Do NOT overwrite the files from the previous version. Expand the content of the "web" directory of
   the new package into a new directory on the web server.
2) Check the access rights on the files/folders: the setup needs to have write access either to the
   whole directory where iTop is installed or to the following subdirectories (create them if needed)
    - conf
    - data
    - env-production
    - log

3) Point your web browser to the URL corresponding to the new location. You should see the setup screen.
4) When prompted (At step 2 of the installation), choose "Upgrade an existing instance"
5) Either enter the path (on the disk) to the previous instance, or supply the needed credentials.
6) Run the setup to completion. Once this is done you can connect to your upgraded iTop.
7) To replace the old instance of iTop with the newly installed one:
   Rename the directories to switch the locations
   Edit the new configuration file (now located at <itop>/conf/production/config-itop.php) and change the
   value of the "application_url" parameter.

2.5. Migrating from 1.x versions
     ---------------------------
The setup is designed to upgrade existing 1.x instances of iTop automatically. In case the instance was
customized (for example by altering its data model), the installation process will detect the modifications
(by scanning the source files and comparing them with the manifest) and will prompt either to keep the
modifications or to discard them.

If the location of mysql binaries is in the "path", the installation proposes to perform a full backup
of iTop (database + configuration file) using mysqldump.

Here is how to upgrade, step by step, a 1.x instance of iTop.

1) Do NOT overwrite the files from the previous version. Expand the content of the "web" directory of
   the new package into a new directory on the web server.
2) Check the access rights on the files/folders: the setup needs to have write access either to the
   directory where iTop is installed or to the following subdirectories (create them if needed)
    - conf
    - data
    - env-production
    - log

3) Point your web browser to the URL corresponding to the new location. You should see the setup screen.
4) When prompted (At step 2 of the installation), choose "Upgrade an existing instance"
5) Enter the needed credentials. It is not mandatory to supply the location (on the disk of the server)
   where the previous instance was installed but, by doing so, you let the installation find the credentials
   (by looking at the previous configuration file) and also perform additional checks, for instance, to
   detect any customization that you may have made to iTop.
6) Run the setup to completion. Once this is done you can connect to your upgraded iTop.
7) To replace the old instance of iTop with the newly installed one:
   Rename the directories to switch the locations
   Edit the new configuration file (now located at <itop>/conf/production/config-itop.php) and change the
   value of the "application_url" parameter.

That's it.

3. FEATURES
   ========

3.1. Changes since 2.2.0
     -------------------
This release fixes a few issues:

#1174: support HTML fields in the bulk modify forms (capability to enable/disable the field live)
#1183: more refactoring and some robustness enhancements after tests on big datasets.
#1153: preserve leading zeroes (in "numeric" fields) in the Excel export.
#1183: grouping threshold is now taken into account for "Depends on..." graphs (i.e. grouping backwards)
#1176: empty placeholders are represented by an empty string as in previous version.
#1165 backup with errors fills up tmp-directories with lots of backup-files
#1150: Spurious message "A restore is running..." - FIXED !
Support of derived classes in "add_remove" edition mode for AttributeLinkSet fields (the search form was not refreshing / loading properly when toggling the class to search for).
Make ReloadSearchForm work properly when the "submit" event handler is declared either with or without a "namespace" portion (e.g. 'submit.itop' vs 'submit')
#1164: typo in German localization.
Support the download of "bigger-than-memory" backup files.
Do NOT localize finalclass values in REST/JSON.
#1159 Cannot add edge (impact analysis not working depending on the data model customizations)
#1156: properly escape file paths containing spaces
#1196: Only adminitrator accounts can be used to create attachments by the mean of the REST/JSON API
Better error reporting when the setup fails to create a directory.

Internals:
IconSelectorField (Design time !) can be read-only.
Properly read radio button values inside a form.
Remove _altered_in when exporting the delta.
Keep track of which module altered which node in the XML.
Fixed the computation of the lowest common ancestor.
Dehardcoded OqlUnionQuery::GetClass against the metamodel reflection API
Added AttributeDef::EnumTemplateVerbs, to generate the documentation about the available attribute formatting placeholders
MFFactory: fixed GetDelta when there is no change at all
Added structured error reporting in case of missing dependencies for the modules to install.
Properly create DOMNodes with a text content (beware of XML entities inside the text)
Support validation patterns containing a forward slash
Code refactoring to make the OQL parsing self contained in the "oql" subdirectory.
Added a version number (arbitrary initialized to 2015-08-31 for iTop v2.2.0) to the OQL Lexer/parser.
Do not rely on MetaModel::GetRootClass() to check the data model, use the abstraction of ModelReflection instead to keep the code portable.
