Prerequisites:

iTop requires
- A web server running PHP 5.2.0 or higher, with PCRE, SESSION, mysql, iconv, simplexml and soap support.
  If you wish to use LDAP authentication, then LDAP support must be enabled in PHP. 
- A connection to MySQL 5.0 or higher

Web browser support:
iTop is developed using FireFox 3.x and tested with IE 7 and IE 8.

Installation:

1. Unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories) and copy the
   content of the "web" directory in your webserver's document root. If you
   don't have direct access to the web server's file system, put the files
   in a directory on your local machine and transfer the content of the
   directory on your web server using, for example, ftp.

2. Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is running in
   safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different from the owner of
   other scripts will be a problem).

3. Open the main iTop directory in your web browser. iTop should then display
   the setup instructions on screen.
